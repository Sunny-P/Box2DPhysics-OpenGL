Left Clicking in the area left of the slingshot will spawn a bird.

The force applied to the bird is intended to be determined based on mousePosition->Slingshot position.
The bird may or may not be flung with a big enough force to fly very far. This is due to Box2D not being deterministic, caused by different compilers and processor architecture doing floating point math differently.

Joints Implemented:
Revolute Joint,	In First level
Pulley Joint,	In Second level
